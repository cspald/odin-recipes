    <h3>Description</h3>
		<p>We are singing all the praises of apple crisp because it is THE dessert of the season. Featuring warm gooey cinnamon apples and a brown sugar oat topping, this comfort food classic takes half the time and effort that traditional apple pie requires. You just need a handful of basic ingredients to get started including baking apples such as Granny Smith and Honeycrisp.</p>
        <p>Today, let us get down to the basics. This is pure and simple apple crisp, a timeless dessert highlighting the natural flavor of apples. This apple dessert is an end-of-the-meal treat that delivers BIG flavor for very little work. Let us be honest if you can chop apples, you can make apple crisp.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <h5>Filling</h5>
            <ul>
                <li>8 medium peeled apples, cut into 1-inch chunks that are 1/4 – 1/2 inch thick (about 10 cups, or 1200g, chunks)</li>
                <li>1/2 cup (100g) packed light or dark brown sugar</li>
                <li>1/4 cup (31g) all-purpose flour (spoon & leveled)</li>
                <li>1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract</li>
                <li>1 teaspoon ground cinnamon</li>
                <li>1/2 teaspoon ground nutmeg</li>
                <li>1/4 teaspoon salt</li>
            </ul>
        <h5>Topping</h5>
            <ul>
                <li>3/4 cup (94g) all-purpose flour (spoon & leveled)</li>
                <li>3/4 cup (150g) packed light or dark brown sugar</li>
                <li>1 teaspoon ground cinnamon</li>
                <li>1/2 cup (1 stick; 115g) unsalted butter, cold and cubed</li>
                <li>1 cup (80g) old-fashioned whole oats</li>
                <li>optional: salted caramel and vanilla ice cream for serving</li>
            </ul>
	<h3>Steps</h3>
		<ol>
            <li>Preheat oven to 350°F (177°C). Lightly grease a 9×13-inch baking pan. Any 4-quart baking dish works.</li>
            <li>Mix all of the filling ingredients together in a large bowl, then spread into the baking pan.</li>
            <li>Make the topping: Whisk the flour, brown sugar, and cinnamon together in a medium bowl. Cut in the butter using a pastry cutter or fork until the mixture becomes super crumbly. Stir in the oats. Sprinkle over filling.</li>
            <li>Bake for 45 minutes or until the topping is golden brown and the fruit juices are bubbling around the edges. Remove from the oven, place on a wire rack, and allow to cool for at least 5 minutes before serving. Serve warm, room temperature, or cold; plain or with salted caramel and/or vanilla ice cream.</li>
            <li>Cover leftovers and store in the refrigerator for up to 5 days.</li>
		</ol>
	<h3>Tips</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Make Ahead & Freezing Instructions: Baked and cooled crisp freezes well for up to 3 months. Thaw overnight in the refrigerator, then bake (covered) in a 350°F (177°C) for 30 minutes or until heated through. You can prepare the crisp through step 3, then cover and refrigerate for up to 1 day before baking. You can also freeze the unbaked crisp for up to 3 months. Allow to thaw overnight in the refrigerator, then continue with step 4. Bake time will be a little longer since the crisp will be cold. </li>
            <li>Apples: See blog post above for the best apples to use. An equal mix of Granny Smith and Jazz or Pink Lady is my favorite for apple crisp. </li>
            <li>Oats: Whole oats are best, but you can use quick oats if needed. The crumble topping will just be a little more powdery. (Don’t be tempted to reduce the flour, though– the topping may turn out greasy.) Use a 1:1 swap from whole oats to quick oats. For an oat-less topping, see blog post above.</li>
            <li>Nuts: Feel free to add 1 cup of chopped pecans or walnuts to the crisp topping. Stir into the mixture when you add the oats. </li>
            <li>Half Recipe: You can easily halve this recipe by halving all of the ingredients and baking in a 9-inch square or round baking dish. Reduce bake time to about 30-35 minutes.</li>

        </ul>
